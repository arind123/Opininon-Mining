Problem Statement
The data set contains opinions of 38 different people on the following question:
”What qualities do you think are necessary to be the prime minister of India?”
The data set is already supplied to you in an excel file. Each row from second row onward in the
excel file indicates the comment of a particular person. The task is to find the significant
comments from this data. You have to use Wordnet, an English lexical database to accomplish
the task. Some experts had already reviewed the data set and found significant qualities manually
from the data. The human coding is also sent to you. The objective is to analyze the performance
of your method using the human coding. You may discuss whether the method using Wordnet is
able to identify the significant opinions or not.
